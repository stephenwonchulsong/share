1,1001,YouTube Shorts,Washington Post,This high school student is working to unify America | Opinion,"Founding president of the debate club at our school—I founded the club specifically to harp on this point! It doesn’t matter which side you align yourself with, most people want the same things at the end of the day. Whether you think the liberals are grooming the children or that the Conservative Party is beginning to resemble Hitler’s ride to power, you still probably can agree that we want to make everyone’s lives better, we want to preserve freedom, and we want to make better and more informed decisions. An exercise I’ve done for people is to take a given candidates speech and put a blank where they mention specific names and things—you’d be surprised at how many that you can’t distinguish between left or right",1,724,1,4,1,4

If you get it in order, you get extra points.” Then, “10 minutes, 15, 20 minutes later” in the cognitive exam, “they say, ‘Remember the first question?’ Not the first, but the tenth question. ‘Give us that again. Can you do that again?’ And you go, ‘Person, woman, man, camera, TV,’” Trump recounted. The president said doctors had warned him “nobody gets it in order,” and he assessed that “it’s actually not that easy. But for me, it was easy.” Trump also emphasized that the medical professionals conducting the exam “don’t tell you” they plan on asking patients to repeat the word series, and said they were impressed by him doing so. “‘Can you do it?’ And you go, ‘Person, woman, man, camera, TV,’” Trump said. “They say, ‘That’s amazing, how did you do that?’ I do it because I have, like, a good memory. Because I’m cognitively there.”",9,1199,1,2,0,
